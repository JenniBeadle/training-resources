    <h2>Creating chatbots to help users</h2>
    <p>This summer, two interns, with help from several colleagues from SIL Language Technology Use, have produced an astonishing number of chatbots that can help in over 29 languages! </p>
    <p>To start a chatbot, click on the speech icon in the bottom right corner of the webpage <br><img src="https://jennibeadle.github.io/training-resources/images/ChatBotIcon.png" alt="icon to click to start a chatbot conversation" height="50" width="50">. </p>
    <p>It only shows in English, but you can type your question in any language, and it will switch and respond in that language.</p>
    <p>This is the question <img src="https://jennibeadle.github.io/training-resources/images/ChatBotFrenchQ.png" alt="ChatBox question" height="200"> and
this is the response in French <img src="https://jennibeadle.github.io/training-resources/images/ChatBotFrenchR.png" alt="ChatBox response in French" height="200"> </p>
    <p></p> 
    <p>It has only been going for a few weeks, and already there has been a lot of use. Here is a GIF showing the requests in the top ten languages in the first few weeks.
