<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>David in Chad contacts you frustrated because his notebook has shut down unexpectedly three times this week while he was working. He says there&#39;s no warning—it just turns off suddenly. When he restarts it, sometimes it works fine for hours, other times it shuts down again within 30 minutes. He mentions that it seems to happen more often when he&#39;s running his translation software and has multiple documents open.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s dry season, and dust is a constant problem. David works in a small office with no air conditioning. He&#39;s been in location for 8 months and hasn&#39;t done any maintenance on the computer.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-c1-the-cascade-of-problems">Scenario C1: The Cascade of Problems</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>Lisa in Ethiopia contacts you with a complicated situation. Two days ago, there was a severe thunderstorm and power surge. Her notebook was plugged in at the time (no surge protector). After the storm, the computer seemed to work, but she noticed the battery icon showed &quot;not charging.&quot; She continued working on battery power. Yesterday, the computer shut down (battery depleted), and now when she tries to start it, she gets the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power light comes on briefly then goes off</li>
<li>She hears a clicking sound from inside the computer</li>
<li>Screen remains black</li>
<li>Sometimes she smells a faint burning odor</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>Lisa is 4 hours from the nearest city where replacement parts might be available. She has critical translation work due in one week. There&#39;s another language worker in a nearby village (2 hours away) who might be able to loan equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Your task:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze the multiple symptoms—what components are likely damaged?</li>
<li>Is this something Lisa should attempt to troubleshoot further, or should she pursue other options immediately? Explain your reasoning.</li>
<li>What is your recommended action plan, considering the time constraint and resource limitations?</li>
<li>After this incident is resolved, what systemic changes would you recommend for Lisa&#39;s work setup?</li>

<h3 id="scenario-c2-the-gradual-decline">Scenario C2: The Gradual Decline</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>Robert in Cameroon describes a pattern that&#39;s been developing over several months: His notebook has gradually become less reliable. The timeline he provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 months ago: occasional unexplained restarts</li>
<li>2 months ago: programs started crashing more frequently</li>
<li>1 month ago: display sometimes shows colored lines or flickers</li>
<li>This week: computer sometimes doesn&#39;t recognize his external hard drive when he plugs it in, and yesterday Windows gave an error message about a &quot;hardware malfunction&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The computer still works, but he&#39;s worried about losing data and wants to know if he should request a replacement or if these issues can be resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>Robert works in a hot, dusty environment. He backs up his work to an external drive weekly but hasn&#39;t backed up in the past 10 days. The nearest IT support is a 6-hour journey. Requesting and receiving a replacement notebook typically takes 2-3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Your task:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What pattern do you see in these symptoms, and what does it suggest about the underlying problem(s)?</li>
<li>What is the urgency level of this situation—should Robert continue using the computer or take immediate action?</li>
<li>Outline a comprehensive action plan that addresses both immediate concerns and long-term solutions.</li>
<li>How would you help Robert think through the trade-offs of continuing with this computer versus requesting a replacement?</li>

<h3 id="scenario-c3-the-diagnostic-challenge">Scenario C3: The Diagnostic Challenge</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>You receive this message from Kenji in Nepal: &quot;My computer is acting strange. Sometimes when I&#39;m typing, the cursor jumps to a different place on the screen, or a window I wasn&#39;t clicking on suddenly comes to the front. At first, I thought I was accidentally touching the touchpad, but it happens even when my hands are only on the keyboard. Also, maybe unrelated, but sometimes the computer seems to start doing things on its own—I&#39;ll see the cursor moving or programs opening when I&#39;m not touching anything. It&#39;s making it really difficult to work.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>Kenji works in a mountainous region with temperature extremes (very cold at night, warm during the day). He mentions that the problems seem worse in the morning when he first starts working. His antivirus software is up to date, and he&#39;s careful about what he downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Your task:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This scenario could have hardware or software causes (or both). What are the possible explanations you would consider?</li>
<li>Design a systematic diagnostic process to determine the root cause. What would you have Kenji check or try, and in what order?</li>
<li>Based on the most likely cause, what solution would you recommend?</li>
<li>If your initial diagnosis turns out to be wrong, what would be your alternative hypothesis and approach?</li>
</ol>
