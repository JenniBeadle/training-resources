<h2 id="section-3-1-the-consultant-s-judgment-calls">Section 3.1: The Consultant&#39;s Judgment Calls</h2>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 15 minutes</p>
<h3 id="beyond-technical-diagnosis">Beyond Technical Diagnosis</h3>
<p>You&#39;ve learned to diagnose hardware problems. But diagnosis is only part of your job. You also need to make <strong>practical recommendations</strong> considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource availability</li>
<li>User capability</li>
<li>Cost vs. benefit</li>
<li>Urgency and timelines</li>
<li>Work continuity</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren&#39;t purely technical decisions - they require judgment.</p>
<h3 id="decision-framework-three-paths">Decision Framework: Three Paths</h3>
<p>For every problem, you have three possible recommendations:</p>
<p><strong>Path 1: USER CAN FIX (with guidance)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Path 2: ESCALATE to IT support</strong></p>
<p><strong>Path 3: REPLACE equipment</strong></p>
<p>Let&#39;s explore when each is appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="path-1-user-can-fix">PATH 1: User Can Fix</h3>
<p><strong>When this is appropriate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Problem is clearly diagnosed</li>
<li>Solution is within user capability</li>
<li>Risk is low (won&#39;t make things worse)</li>
<li>You can provide clear guidance</li>
<li>User expresses comfort with the task</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning dust from vents</li>
<li>Freeing up disk space</li>
<li>Reseating RAM (if user comfortable)</li>
<li>Using external mouse (touchpad issue)</li>
<li>Basic troubleshooting steps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to decide if user can do it:</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I explain this clearly in writing?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the worst that could happen if they make a mistake?</li>
<li>Does this require special tools?</li>
<li>Have they done anything like this before?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Always provide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear, step-by-step instructions</li>
<li>Safety warnings</li>
<li>Photos/diagrams if possible</li>
<li>&quot;If you&#39;re not comfortable, it&#39;s okay to escalate&quot;</li>
<li>What to do if it doesn&#39;t work</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="path-2-escalate-to-it-support">PATH 2: Escalate to IT Support</h3>
<p><strong>When this is appropriate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnosis uncertain (need hands-on investigation)</li>
<li>Repair requires technical skills beyond user</li>
<li>Requires special tools or parts</li>
<li>High risk of making things worse</li>
<li>Hardware needs replacement but you&#39;re confirming first</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Display cable repair</li>
<li>Motherboard issues</li>
<li>Complex multi-component failures</li>
<li>Physical damage repair</li>
<li>When your troubleshooting hasn&#39;t resolved it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to escalate effectively:</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t just say &quot;I can&#39;t help, contact IT.&quot; Provide value by documenting what you know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms (specific details)</li>
<li>Tests you&#39;ve already done</li>
<li>Results of those tests</li>
<li>What you&#39;ve ruled out</li>
<li>Your hypothesis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This saves IT time and helps the user.</strong> Good escalation looks like:</p>
<p>&quot;Based on my troubleshooting, this appears to be a display cable issue rather than the screen itself, because an external monitor works fine. The user has already tried reseating the RAM and checking connections. I recommend IT examine the display cable connection, which may have come loose or been damaged. The user can continue working with an external monitor in the meantime.&quot;</p>
<p>versus:</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, contact IT.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="path-3-replace-equipment">PATH 3: Replace Equipment</h3>
<p><strong>When this is appropriate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple component failures</li>
<li>Repair cost approaches replacement cost</li>
<li>Computer is old (3-5+ years in harsh environments)</li>
<li>Imminent complete failure</li>
<li>Critical component failed (motherboard, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to make this call:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age of computer:</strong> 5-year-old computer with failing motherboard = replace</li>
<li><strong>Cost of repair:</strong> $300 repair on $500 computer = replace</li>
<li><strong>Repair timeline:</strong> 6 weeks for repair vs. 3 weeks for replacement = replace</li>
<li><strong>Work criticality:</strong> User&#39;s work can&#39;t wait = replace</li>
<li><strong>Failure pattern:</strong> Progressive deterioration = replace before complete failure</li>
<li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Will this just fail again soon? = replace</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But also consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead time:</strong> If replacement takes 3 months, might need repair</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Can we get replacement parts/computers?</li>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> What&#39;s actually feasible?</li>
<li><strong>Temporary solutions:</strong> Can user work on borrowed equipment while waiting?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to recommend replacement:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Based on the pattern of failures - overheating, display issues, now port failures - and the age of this computer (4 years in a hot, dusty environment), I recommend requesting a replacement rather than attempting repairs. The multiple deteriorating systems suggest other failures are likely soon. I recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Request replacement immediately (given 2-3 month lead time)</li>
<li>Back up all critical data now</li>
<li>Minimize use of current computer (only essential work)</li>
<li>Consider borrowing equipment if available while waiting</li>
</ol>
<p>The current computer can likely limp along for a few more weeks if used minimally, which gives time for replacement to arrive.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="complex-decision-repair-and-replace">Complex Decision: Repair AND Replace</h3>
<p>Sometimes you recommend both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporary repair/workaround NOW</li>
<li>Replacement request started (for later)</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: &quot;The power adapter has failed. Request a replacement adapter (2-3 weeks delivery), but also request a new computer (2-3 months) because this computer is showing signs of progressive failure. The adapter will get you working again quickly, but you&#39;ll need new equipment soon.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="activity-3-1-make-the-call">Activity 3.1: Make the Call</h3>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>For each scenario, decide: User can fix / Escalate / Replace? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario A:</strong></p>
<p>Computer is 6 months old. Screen has developed a single dead pixel (tiny black spot). Everything else works perfectly. User finds it annoying but can work fine.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario B:</strong></p>
<p>Computer is 4 years old, in dusty environment. Now showing: frequent overheating shutdowns, display flickering, USB ports intermittent, clicking sounds from hard drive. User has critical translation project due in 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario C:</strong></p>
<p>Computer has three beeps on startup, black screen. Just happened today after user transported it. Computer is 1 year old, otherwise has worked fine.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario D:</strong></p>
<p>Power adapter cable is frayed near the connector. Still works but sometimes has to be positioned just right. User says it&#39;s been like this for a month.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario E:</strong></p>
<p>Battery no longer holds charge - only works plugged in. Computer is 3 years old. Battery replacement costs $80, lead time 4-6 weeks. User works in location with reliable power.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="activity-3-1-sample-answers">Activity 3.1: Sample Answers</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario A: User can live with it (no action needed)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dead pixel is cosmetic, doesn&#39;t affect function</li>
<li>Repair would require screen replacement (expensive, not justified)</li>
<li>If it bothers user greatly, could escalate, but usually not worth it</li>
<li>Document in case more pixels fail (then might indicate larger problem)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario B: Replace</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple failing systems (storage, cooling, display, ports)</li>
<li>Age + environment = expected wear</li>
<li>Clicking hard drive = imminent failure risk</li>
<li>Time constraint (2 weeks) = can&#39;t wait for complex repairs</li>
<li><strong>IMMEDIATE:</strong> Back up data, request replacement, minimize use</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario C: User can fix (with guidance)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Classic RAM unseated from transport</li>
<li>Computer is relatively new (worth fixing)</li>
<li>Reseating RAM is straightforward</li>
<li>Walk user through it or escalate if they&#39;re not comfortable</li>
<li>Good preventive advice opportunity (padded transport)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario D: Replace adapter immediately</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frayed cable is safety hazard (fire risk, shock risk)</li>
<li>Will fail completely soon (can&#39;t wait)</li>
<li>Adapters are relatively inexpensive</li>
<li>This is urgent - don&#39;t let user keep using it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario E: Depends on context</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If reliable power and user doesn&#39;t need portability: Live with it (no repair needed)</li>
<li>If user needs mobility: Replace battery</li>
<li>Could also consider: If computer otherwise near end of life, might replace entire computer instead of investing in battery</li>
<li>No urgency if power is reliable, so user can decide based on their needs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> These aren&#39;t always technical decisions - they&#39;re practical judgments based on context, resources, risk, and user needs.</p>

<h2 id="section-3-2-resource-constraints-and-workarounds">Section 3.2: Resource Constraints and Workarounds</h2>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<h3 id="the-reality-of-remote-locations">The Reality of Remote Locations</h3>
<p>Your users aren&#39;t in cities with easy access to computer repair shops. They face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited or no replacement parts available locally</li>
<li>Weeks or months for parts to arrive</li>
<li>No local technical support</li>
<li>Work that can&#39;t stop while waiting for parts</li>
<li>Budget constraints</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your job: Help them keep working despite these constraints.</strong></p>
<h3 id="workaround-strategies">Workaround Strategies</h3>
<h4 id="1-identify-what-can-work">1. Identify what CAN work</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t focus only on what&#39;s broken. Find what still functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display broken? Use external monitor</li>
<li>Touchpad issues? Use USB mouse</li>
<li>Battery dead? Work plugged in</li>
<li>Keyboard keys not working? Use external keyboard or on-screen keyboard</li>
<li>Port not working? Use different port</li>
<li>Slow hard drive? Boot from external drive (advanced, but possible)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-prioritize-partial-solutions">2. Prioritize partial solutions</h4>
<p>A solution that&#39;s 80% effective NOW is often better than a perfect solution in 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Example: Laptop overheats and shuts down after 30 minutes</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect solution:</strong> Replace cooling system (6 weeks for parts)</li>
<li><strong>Partial solution NOW:</strong> Aggressive cleaning, cooling pad, work in short sessions, save frequently</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> User can continue working (carefully) while waiting for parts</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-creative-problem-solving">3. Creative problem-solving</h4>
<p>Think beyond standard repairs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can user borrow equipment from another worker temporarily?</li>
<li>Can some work be done on a phone or tablet while laptop is down?</li>
<li>Can two users share one working computer temporarily?</li>
<li>Is there a regional office that might have spare parts?</li>
<li>Can user travel to city for repair if deadline is critical?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-preventive-triage">4. Preventive triage</h4>
<p>When resources are limited, prevention becomes even more critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surge protector (cheap, prevents expensive failures)</li>
<li>Regular cleaning (free, prevents overheating)</li>
<li>Good backups (essential, enables recovery)</li>
<li>Careful handling (free, prevents damage)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A $20 surge protector prevents a $800 motherboard replacement</strong> - this math matters in resource-constrained environments.</p>
<h3 id="activity-3-2-find-the-workaround">Activity 3.2: Find the Workaround</h3>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p>For each situation, identify a workaround that lets the user continue working while waiting for permanent solution:</p>
<p><strong>Situation 1:</strong> Hard drive is clicking and failing. Replacement will take 6 weeks. User has backed up data. How can they keep working?</p>
<p><strong>Situation 2:</strong> Laptop constantly overheats and shuts down. Fan replacement parts not available locally. User has critical deadline in 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Situation 3:</strong> Four keys on keyboard don&#39;t work (water damage). Keyboard replacement will take 8 weeks. User does a lot of typing.</p>
<h4 id="sample-solutions-">Sample Solutions:</h4>
<p><strong>1. Hard drive failing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If there&#39;s another language worker nearby:</strong> Borrow their laptop temporarily, restore from backup</li>
<li><strong>If organization has spare equipment:</strong> Request temporary loaner while waiting for repair</li>
<li><strong>If neither available:</strong><ul>
<li>External hard drive with portable OS (advanced but possible)</li>
<li>Reduce computer use to only critical tasks</li>
<li>Use internet café/library computers for non-sensitive work</li>
<li>Work on borrowed computer with cloud-based tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Overheating:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Immediate cooling measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work in coolest location/time of day</li>
<li>Aggressive vent cleaning</li>
<li>Elevate laptop for maximum airflow</li>
<li>Remove bottom panel entirely if comfortable (increases airflow)</li>
<li>Work in 20-minute sessions, let cool between</li>
<li>Use temperature monitoring, stop before shutdown</li>
<li>Cooling pad if any available locally</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reduce heat generation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Close all unnecessary programs</li>
<li>Lower screen brightness</li>
<li>Disable background processes</li>
<li>Work with fewer programs simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work process adaptation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Save frequently (expect shutdowns)</li>
<li>Break work into smaller chunks</li>
<li>Do heat-intensive tasks (video, heavy computation) only when absolutely necessary</li>
<li>Consider: could some work be done on phone/tablet?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Keyboard keys not working:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External USB keyboard</strong> (often available locally, inexpensive)</li>
<li><strong>On-screen keyboard</strong> (built into OS, but slower)</li>
<li><strong>Remap keys:</strong> Use other rarely-used keys for the broken ones (software solution)</li>
<li><strong>Combination:</strong> External keyboard for desk work, on-screen for portable work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Workarounds don&#39;t have to be elegant - they just have to let work continue.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h3>
<p>You&#39;ve learned the components, the diagnostic process, the patterns, and the decision-making frameworks. Now let&#39;s apply everything to complex, realistic scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>These scenarios will be assessed by your mentor.</strong> Take your time, think systematically, and write detailed responses.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-scenario-1-the-cascade-of-problems">Assessment Scenario 1: The Cascade of Problems</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>Lisa in Ethiopia contacts you with a complicated situation. Two days ago, there was a severe thunderstorm and power surge. Her notebook was plugged in at the time (no surge protector). After the storm, the computer seemed to work, but she noticed the battery icon showed &quot;not charging.&quot; She continued working on battery power. Yesterday, the computer shut down (battery depleted), and now when she tries to start it, she gets the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power light comes on briefly then goes off</li>
<li>She hears a clicking sound from inside the computer</li>
<li>Screen remains black</li>
<li>Sometimes she smells a faint burning odor</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>Lisa is 4 hours from the nearest city where replacement parts might be available. She has critical translation work due in one week. There&#39;s another language worker in a nearby village (2 hours away) who might be able to loan equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Your task - provide detailed written responses:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Analyze the symptoms:</strong> What components are likely damaged? Explain your reasoning for each.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assess urgency:</strong> Should Lisa attempt further troubleshooting, or should she pursue other options immediately? Explain why.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recommend an action plan:</strong> What specific steps should Lisa take, considering the time constraint and resource limitations? Put them in order of priority.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prevention:</strong> After this incident is resolved, what systemic changes would you recommend for Lisa&#39;s work setup?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Submit your complete analysis to your mentor for feedback.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>Robert in Cameroon describes a pattern that&#39;s been developing over several months: His notebook has gradually become less reliable. The timeline he provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 months ago: occasional unexplained restarts</li>
<li>2 months ago: programs started crashing more frequently</li>
<li>1 month ago: display sometimes shows colored lines or flickers</li>
<li>This week: computer sometimes doesn&#39;t recognize his external hard drive when he plugs it in, and yesterday Windows gave an error message about a &quot;hardware malfunction&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The computer still works, but he&#39;s worried about losing data and wants to know if he should request a replacement or if these issues can be resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>Robert works in a hot, dusty environment. He backs up his work to an external drive weekly but hasn&#39;t backed up in the past 10 days. The nearest IT support is a 6-hour journey. Requesting and receiving a replacement notebook typically takes 2-3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Your task - provide detailed written responses:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Pattern analysis:</strong> What pattern do you see in these symptoms, and what does it suggest about the underlying problem(s)?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Urgency assessment:</strong> What is the urgency level of this situation - should Robert continue using the computer or take immediate action? Explain your reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive action plan:</strong> Outline both immediate actions and long-term solutions. Consider data protection, work continuity, and the 2-3 month replacement timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Decision guidance:</strong> How would you help Robert think through the trade-offs of continuing with this computer versus requesting a replacement?</p>
</li>

<h3 id="assessment-scenario-3-the-diagnostic-challenge">Assessment Scenario 3: The Diagnostic Challenge</h3>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>You receive this message from Kenji in Nepal: &quot;My computer is acting strange. Sometimes when I&#39;m typing, the cursor jumps to a different place on the screen, or a window I wasn&#39;t clicking on suddenly comes to the front. At first, I thought I was accidentally touching the touchpad, but it happens even when my hands are only on the keyboard. Also, maybe unrelated, but sometimes the computer seems to start doing things on its own—I&#39;ll see the cursor moving or programs opening when I&#39;m not touching anything. It&#39;s making it really difficult to work.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>Kenji works in a mountainous region with temperature extremes (very cold at night, warm during the day). He mentions that the problems seem worse in the morning when he first starts working. His antivirus software is up to date, and he&#39;s careful about what he downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Your task - provide detailed written responses:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Possible explanations:</strong> This scenario could have hardware OR software causes (or both). What are at least 3 different possible explanations you would consider?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Systematic diagnostic process:</strong> Design a step-by-step diagnostic plan to determine the root cause. What would you have Kenji check or try, and in what order? Explain why you&#39;ve chosen this sequence.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Solution recommendation:</strong> Based on what you think is the MOST likely cause, what solution would you recommend? Be specific.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Contingency plan:</strong> If your initial diagnosis turns out to be wrong, what would be your alternative hypothesis and approach?</p>
</li>

<h3 id="c3-the-diagnostic-challenge-answer-guide">C3: The Diagnostic Challenge - Answer Guide</h3>
<p><strong>What&#39;s Happening:</strong></p>
<p>This scenario is deliberately ambiguous and could be either hardware OR software (or both). It tests whether learners can think through multiple hypotheses and design systematic diagnostic processes.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Explanations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>HARDWARE possibilities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Failing touchpad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Touchpad becoming hypersensitive or registering phantom touches</li>
<li>Temperature changes affect touchpad calibration</li>
<li>Could explain cursor jumping and &quot;touches&quot; when not touching</li>
<li>&quot;Worse in morning when cold&quot; supports this (hardware behaves differently at different temperatures)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Touchpad palm rejection failure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not detecting palms vs. intentional touches</li>
<li>Could cause cursor jumping while typing</li>
<li>But doesn&#39;t explain cursor moving when hands completely off</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Physical damage or moisture in touchpad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature extremes could cause condensation</li>
<li>Morning cold then warming up leads to condensation</li>
<li>Could create false inputs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Keyboard or touchpad cable issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Loose connection affected by temperature changes</li>
<li>Could cause erratic behavior</li>
<li>Temperature cycling (cold night, warm day) stresses connections</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Motherboard issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Less likely but possible</li>
<li>Temperature-dependent electrical problems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SOFTWARE possibilities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Malware (despite antivirus):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remote access trojan (RAT)</li>
<li>Could explain cursor moving and programs opening &quot;on their own&quot;</li>
<li>Antivirus isn&#39;t perfect</li>
<li>&quot;Things starting on their own&quot; is classic RAT behavior</li>
<li>BUT: &quot;worse in morning&quot; doesn&#39;t fit malware pattern well</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Software conflict or driver issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Touchpad driver corrupted or conflicting</li>
<li>Recent Windows update causing problems</li>
<li>Software behaving strangely at startup (timing issue)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Accessibility feature accidentally enabled:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mouse Keys or similar feature</li>
<li>Could cause unexpected cursor behavior</li>
<li>Less likely given description</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Background process interfering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some program taking control at specific times</li>
<li>Scheduled task running in morning</li>
<li>Could explain timing pattern</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BOTH (hardware + software):</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Hardware problem triggering software response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Touchpad malfunction causing OS to misinterpret inputs</li>
<li>Best fit for all symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Systematic Diagnostic Process:</strong></p>
<p>Strong answers will design a <strong>methodical elimination process:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 - Gather more information (Questions to ask Kenji):</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Clarify the &quot;on its own&quot; behavior:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly happens? (cursor just moves, or clicks happen too?)</li>
<li>Which programs open?</li>
<li>Does it happen at specific times or randomly?</li>
<li>Does it ever happen when he&#39;s watching but not touching anything?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Temperature correlation details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What&#39;s the morning temperature vs. during day?</li>
<li>Does behavior improve as computer warms up, or stay bad all day?</li>
<li>Has he noticed condensation on or around computer?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Timing patterns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only first thing in morning, or other times too?</li>
<li>How long after starting computer does it begin?</li>
<li>Does restarting help or make it worse?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Recent changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any new software installed?</li>
<li>Any Windows updates recently?</li>
<li>Any physical incidents (drops, spills)?</li>
<li>Working in new location?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Antivirus and security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What antivirus? When last updated?</li>
<li>Full scan recently?</li>
<li>Any security warnings ever?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2 - Simple tests (non-invasive):</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Disable touchpad test:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>External USB mouse + completely disable touchpad in settings</li>
<li>If problems stop then touchpad hardware issue</li>
<li>If problems continue then NOT touchpad (malware or other cause)</li>
<li><strong>This is the key diagnostic test</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Safe Mode test:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boot into Safe Mode</li>
<li>Does behavior occur in Safe Mode?</li>
<li>If NO then software/driver issue</li>
<li>If YES then more likely hardware</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Temperature test:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let computer warm to room temperature before starting</li>
<li>Does it change behavior?</li>
<li>Work in warmer location one morning - does it help?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Touchpad settings check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust sensitivity settings</li>
<li>Disable tap-to-click</li>
<li>Change palm rejection settings</li>
<li>Does any setting change the behavior?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 3 - Software investigation (if touchpad test suggests software):</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. Malware scan with multiple tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Second opinion scan (Malwarebytes or similar)</li>
<li>Check startup programs</li>
<li>Review recent software installations</li>
<li>Check browser extensions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. Driver investigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Update touchpad drivers</li>
<li>Roll back recent driver updates</li>
<li>Check for Windows updates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. Process monitoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Watch what processes run in morning</li>
<li>Check scheduled tasks</li>
<li>Monitor network activity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 4 - Hardware investigation (if tests suggest hardware):</strong></p>
<p><strong>13. Physical inspection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for condensation, especially in morning</li>
<li>Check for touchpad damage</li>
<li>Feel for unusual heat in touchpad area</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14. Environmental controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Store computer in warmer location overnight</li>
<li>Use sealed bag with desiccant if condensation suspected</li>
<li>Eliminate temperature cycling</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution Based on Most Likely Cause:</strong></p>
<p><strong>If touchpad hardware issue (most likely given symptoms):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Immediate solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disable built-in touchpad completely</li>
<li>Use external USB mouse permanently</li>
<li>Adjust storage to minimize temperature cycling</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Long-term solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Touchpad replacement (if available/affordable)</li>
<li>Environmental controls (warmer storage, less temperature swing)</li>
<li>Continue with external mouse (practical workaround)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this is most likely:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature correlation (hardware affected by cold)</li>
<li>Cursor behavior even when not typing (rules out palm rejection)</li>
<li>&quot;Worse in morning&quot; fits hardware temperature sensitivity</li>
<li>Mountain location = extreme temperature cycling</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If malware (less likely but possible):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Immediate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full system scan with multiple tools</li>
<li>Check all startup programs</li>
<li>Review installed software</li>
<li>Change all passwords</li>
<li>Disconnect from network while investigating</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If confirmed malware:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full system cleanup or reinstall</li>
<li>Restore from clean backup if available</li>
<li>Review security practices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis if Initial Diagnosis Wrong:</strong></p>
<p>Strong answers will show contingency thinking:</p>
<p>&quot;If disabling the touchpad doesn&#39;t resolve the cursor movement, then we&#39;re likely looking at malware despite the antivirus. The next step would be intensive malware investigation with multiple scanning tools and process monitoring. The temperature correlation might be coincidental, or the malware might be triggered by specific startup conditions that happen to occur more in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>OR:</p>
<p>&quot;If malware scans come back clean and the external mouse also shows strange behavior, we&#39;d need to investigate motherboard or system-level issues, which would likely require professional diagnosis or replacement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Common Mistakes to Watch For:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jumping to conclusion without systematic investigation</li>
<li>Not designing an elimination process</li>
<li>Missing the touchpad disable test (key diagnostic step)</li>
<li>Not considering temperature as genuine hardware factor</li>
<li>Dismissing malware too quickly because antivirus is running</li>
<li>Not having contingency plan for wrong initial diagnosis</li>
<li>Overcomplicated diagnosis when simple test (disable touchpad) would clarify</li>
<li>Not thinking about practical workarounds (external mouse)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ambiguous symptoms require systematic elimination, not guessing</li>
<li>Design tests that clearly distinguish between hypotheses</li>
<li>Environmental factors (temperature) genuinely affect hardware</li>
<li>Simple tests (disable touchpad) can quickly narrow possibilities</li>
<li>Always have &quot;if I&#39;m wrong&quot; backup hypothesis</li>
<li>Good diagnosis is about process, not jumping to answers</li>
<li>Some problems have simple workarounds even if root cause unclear</li>
<li>Remote diagnosis means designing tests user can perform</li>
<li>Multiple possible explanations = need decision tree, not single answer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Exceptional Answers Include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear acknowledgment that this could be multiple things</li>
<li>Well-structured diagnostic decision tree</li>
<li>Specific test that distinguishes hardware from software (touchpad disable)</li>
<li>Questions to gather more information before recommending tests</li>
<li>Recognition of temperature as legitimate diagnostic clue</li>
<li>Practical workaround (external mouse) while investigating</li>
<li>Contingency thinking (&quot;if this doesn&#39;t work, then...&quot;)</li>
<li>Both hardware and software investigation paths</li>
<li>Appropriate level of skepticism about antivirus (not foolproof)</li>
<li>Environmental context (mountain location, temperature extremes) informing diagnosis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This Scenario Tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tolerance for ambiguity</li>
<li>Systematic diagnostic thinking</li>
<li>Hypothesis generation</li>
<li>Test design to distinguish between hypotheses</li>
<li>Recognition that environmental factors matter</li>
<li>Ability to create decision trees, not just linear troubleshooting</li>
<li>Knowing when you need more information</li>
<li>Having backup plans</li>
<li>Practical problem-solving (workarounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is perhaps the most advanced diagnostic challenge because there&#39;s no single &quot;right answer&quot; - it&#39;s about the process and thinking, not reaching a predetermined conclusion.</p>
