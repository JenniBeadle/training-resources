1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,451
All right, let's talk about the
single most important piece of tech

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:06,881
you use every single day, but you
probably never even think about it.

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:08,403
We're going to pull back the curtain.

4
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:09,304
Let's dive in.

5
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:11,167
I mean, think about it.

6
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:15,613
You click, you type, you launch a program, but who's really in charge?

7
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:18,136
What's making all that stuff actually happen?

8
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:20,740
Who's calling the shots behind the scenes?

9
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,792
Well, meet the invisible boss.

10
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:26,586
It's this powerful manager working
around the clock, totally tirelessly,

11
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:28,784
just to make sure everything runs smoothly.

12
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:29,666
And its name?

13
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:32,352
The operating system, or, you know, the OS.

14
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:36,400
It is the absolute unsung hero of your entire digital life.

15
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,150
Okay, so what is it, really?

16
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,033
The best way to think about it is like this.

17
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:42,836
It's the ultimate middleman.

18
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:50,908
It's the essential bridge that lets your software, you know, your apps like Chrome or Word, actually communicate with the hardware, the physical parts of your computer.

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,735
Your screen, your keyboard, the processor inside, they can't talk to each other directly.

20
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,439
The OS is the translator, the bridge.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,467
And yeah, without it, your computer is basically just a really, really expensive paperweight.

22
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:08,455
So this invisible boss, this OS, it's kind of like a master juggler.

23
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:13,503
It's constantly balancing these three super critical jobs just to keep your computer working.

24
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:19,071
And honestly, if you can understand these three jobs, you'll understand your computer on a whole new level.

25
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:20,393
So what are they?

26
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:22,596
First, managing all the physical parts.

27
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:25,200
Second, running and managing all your apps.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,106
And third, providing the interface, the stuff you actually see and click on.

29
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,070
Let's break each one of those down one by one.

30
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:35,189
All right, job number one, hardware management.

31
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:42,797
I mean, every single piece of your computer from the super smart processor, its brain, all the way down to the mouse in your hand is controlled by the OS.

32
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,298
Here's a perfect example.

33
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,703
When you go to open a document, your word processor doesn't just go grab it from the hard drive.

34
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:49,344
No way.

35
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:51,426
It has to ask the OS for permission.

36
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:57,092
The OS is the one that finds the file, loads it into the computer's memory, and then tells the screen to display it.

37
00:01:57,593 --> 00:02:00,876
It is the one and only gatekeeper to all the physical stuff.

38
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:04,104
Okay, so once the OS has a
tight grip on all the hardware,

39
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:07,117
it's time for job number
two, managing all your apps.

40
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:09,519
Think of it like a referee in a chaotic game.

41
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:16,645
You've got your email open, a web browser with like 20 tabs running, maybe some music playing, a video, it's a lot.

42
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:22,891
The OS is that referee in the middle, making sure every single app gets its fair share of the computer's power and memory.

43
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:30,238
It keeps them from crashing into each other, and it's the one that blows the whistle and shuts a program down when it starts to misbehave and freezes up.

44
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:33,303
And job number three, this is the part you actually see.

45
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:44,943
Your desktop, all those icons, the windows you drag around, the menus you click on, that entire visual world you live in on your computer, that is created, drawn, and managed completely by the OS.

46
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:52,075
It's the friendly face to the whole operation, giving you a simple way to control all that incredibly complex machinery humming away underneath.

47
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:56,650
Okay, that's all cool, but why does any of this actually matter to you, right?

48
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:57,852
Well, here's the secret.

49
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:01,679
Understanding these three jobs is like getting a superpower for troubleshooting.

50
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,442
Seriously, let me show you what I mean.

51
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,706
Just look at how this all connects.

52
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:12,257
The next time your printer just won't print, instead of getting frustrated, you can go, aha, that's a hardware management problem.

53
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:17,402
Or when an app totally crashes on you, you'll know, okay, that's the OS's application management job failing somewhere.

54
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:18,062
See?

55
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:21,966
This simple little framework helps you immediately figure out where the problem is coming from.

56
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,568
It's a game changer for solving those everyday computer headaches.

57
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,671
All right, now for the really cool part.

58
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,955
It's one thing for me to talk about all this, but it's another thing to actually see it.

59
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:36,279
We are going to look under the hood right now and watch your OS in action.

60
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,202
Let's peek behind the curtain and see that master juggler at work.

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,371
So are you ready to see just how busy your computer's boss really is?

62
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,474
I'm not kidding.

63
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:48,562
What you're about to see might actually blow your mind a little.

64
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:53,736
If you're new to your computer right now, I highly, highly recommend you follow along with this next part.

65
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,302
Okay, let's do it.

66
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,748
Go ahead and open your system monitor.

67
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:02,600
If you're on Windows, just press control, shift, escape all at once, and that'll bring up the task manager.

68
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:08,154
If you're on a Mac, hit command and the space bar, and then just type activity monitor and press enter.

69
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,881
Welcome to the command center of your computer.

70
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:14,853
Whoa, okay, just take a look at that list of processes.

71
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,275
How many are running right now?

72
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,697
It's not just a couple of apps you have open, is it?

73
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,363
Nope, you're probably seeing dozens, maybe even hundreds of things on that list.

74
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:24,063
What are they?

75
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:34,455
Those are all the little background jobs your OS is running for you, checking for updates, making sure the time is right, handling your Wi-Fi, all the tiny crucial things that are happening constantly.

76
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:39,261
Now find the columns for memory, or RAM, and CPU, the processor.

77
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:42,124
Click on them to sort by what's using the most.

78
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,546
What's at the top of the list?

79
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:45,048
I bet you're going to be surprised.

80
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:47,410
Is it your web browser eating up all the memory?

81
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,614
Or is it some weird background process you've never even heard of?

82
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:51,475
This is it.

83
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:58,063
This is a live look at what your OS is working on right now and where all your computer's power is actually going.

84
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,746
And that's really the whole point, isn't it?

85
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:03,171
All that chaos you're seeing on the screen, that's your OS.

86
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:11,845
That is your operating system at work, silently managing dozens if not hundreds of things all at the same time so that you can just focus on your actual work.

87
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:13,508
So there you have it.

88
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:14,790
You've seen it in action.

89
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,653
You get its three main jobs.

90
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:19,037
You're not just a regular user anymore.

91
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:23,224
You now have the mental toolkit to actually be a troubleshooter.

92
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:27,540
Let's put this new knowledge to the test with a quick classic scenario.

93
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,664
Imagine our friend Maria is working.

94
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:35,615
She's got a web browser open, a PDF, and then suddenly her main translation software just freezes.

95
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:39,222
It's totally locked up, completely unresponsive.

96
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,811
So based on everything we've just talked about, which one of those three big OS jobs is failing right here?

97
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,877
Is this a hardware problem, an application problem, or an interface problem?

98
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:56,406
Think about it, because the next time an app phrases on your computer, you're going to know exactly what's happening under the hood.

99
00:05:56,706 --> 00:06:00,332
And you'll know that your invisible boss is getting ready to step in and handle it.
