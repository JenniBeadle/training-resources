                <h3 class="subsection-title">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Operating Systems for Language Technology Consultants! As a language technology consultant, you support language workers around the world who depend on their computers to do translation, literacy, and linguistic work. While you won't be installing operating systems for everyone, you need to understand how operating systems work so you can:</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Determine whether problems are OS-related or application-related</li>
                    <li>Configure systems properly for language work (especially non-Latin scripts)</li>
                    <li>Guide users through OS settings and troubleshooting remotely</li>
                    <li>Make informed recommendations about OS choices and upgrades</li>
                    <li>Know when to escalate issues to IT specialists</li>
                    <li>Keep your own system running smoothly</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emphasis-text">This course focuses on the <strong>three major operating system families</strong>: Windows, macOS, and Linux - because language workers use all three, depending on their location, resources, and specific needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Why This Course Exists</h3>
                <p>In the past, OS knowledge was assumed as a prerequisite for language technology training. In practice, many consultants arrived without this foundational knowledge, which created barriers to their effectiveness. This course fills that gap by giving you the essential OS understanding you need for all your other LT work.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Learning Approach</h3>
                <p>This course is hands-on. You'll be exploring your actual computer system, not just reading about operating systems in theory. Most activities ask you to examine, document, or adjust settings on your own machine. This approach helps you learn by doing while also improving your own system setup.</p>
                <div class="important-note">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> All activities are designed to be safe and reversible. We'll guide you carefully through any changes, and you can always undo what you've done.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Assessment and Growth</h3>
                <p>Throughout Modules 2 and 3, you'll work through realistic scenarios that language technology consultants encounter. You'll document your responses in your learning journal, and your mentor will review your diagnostic thinking and provide feedback.</p>
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> This course builds <strong>"Has Knowledge"</strong> level competency. You'll continue developing toward <strong>"With Assistance"</strong> and <strong>"Independent"</strong> levels throughout the year as you apply this knowledge in real situations, work with mentors, and gain experience.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Your Learning Journal</h3>
                <p>Throughout this course, you'll be asked to document findings, answer questions, and record your thinking. Keep a learning journal (a simple document or notebook) where you can:</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Record system information you discover</li>
                    <li>Write responses to reflection questions</li>
                    <li>Document troubleshooting steps you take</li>
                    <li>Create checklists and references for future use</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your mentor will ask to see parts of your learning journal as part of the assessment process.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Before you can troubleshoot OS problems or configure systems effectively, you need to understand what an operating system actually does. Most people use computers daily without thinking about the OS - it's invisible until something goes wrong. In this section, you'll develop a clear mental model of the OS's role.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">The OS as Bridge and Manager</h3>
                <p>Think of your operating system as the <strong>bridge between your computer's hardware and the applications you use</strong>. Without an OS, your hardware is just expensive metal and silicon. Without an OS, applications have no way to access the keyboard, display text on screen, save files, or connect to the internet.</p>
                <p>The operating system manages three critical jobs:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h4 class="component-name">1. Managing Hardware Resources</h4>
                <ul class="component-list">
                    <li>Controls access to the processor (CPU)</li>
                    <li>Allocates memory (RAM) to running programs</li>
                    <li>Manages storage (reading and writing files to disk)</li>
                    <li>Handles input devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen)</li>
                    <li>Controls output devices (display, speakers, printers)</li>
                    <li>Manages network connections</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you click to open a document, the OS finds the file on disk, loads it into memory, tells the processor to run the application, and displays the result on screen. The application doesn't talk directly to the hardware - the OS handles all of that.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h4 class="component-name">2. Running and Managing Applications</h4>
                <ul class="component-list">
                    <li>Launches programs when you click them</li>
                    <li>Keeps multiple programs running simultaneously</li>
                    <li>Prevents programs from interfering with each other</li>
                    <li>Closes programs properly when you're done</li>
                    <li>Handles what happens when programs crash or freeze</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you have a word processor, email client, and web browser all open at once, the OS is juggling their competing demands for processor time, memory, and hardware access.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h4 class="component-name">3. Providing the User Interface</h4>
                <ul class="component-list">
                    <li>Creates the desktop, windows, menus, and icons you interact with</li>
                    <li>Handles file management (folders, copying, deleting)</li>
                    <li>Manages user accounts and permissions</li>
                    <li>Provides system settings and control panels</li>
                    <li>Runs background services (like checking for updates or syncing files)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The "look and feel" of your computer - whether it's Windows, macOS, or Linux - is largely determined by how the OS presents itself to you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Why This Matters for Language Technology Work</h3>

                <p>Identifying your OS version (as you did in the previous section) is just the beginning. As a language technology consultant, you need to know how to gather detailed system information and assess whether a system meets the requirements for specific language software.

                <p>When someone contacts you with a problem or asks if they can run certain software, you need more than just "I have Windows 10." You need to know:</p>

                    <li>Available storage space (for installing software and storing files)</li>
                    <li>Graphics capabilities (especially for display-intensive work)</li>
                    <li>Current updates installed (some problems are fixed by updates)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You also need this information to:</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Determine if their system meets software requirements</li>
                    <li>Diagnose performance problems</li>
                    <li>Decide if an upgrade is feasible</li>
                    <li>Plan for new software installations</li>
