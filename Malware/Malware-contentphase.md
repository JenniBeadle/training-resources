## Content: Understanding and Dealing with Malware

Phase 2: Content

### What Does Malware Actually Do?

Let's focus on what you can observe, not technical details you can't see. Malware typically causes one or more of these problems:

#### Your computer acts differently:

-   Dramatically slower than normal
-   Programs crash or won't open
-   New programs or toolbars you didn't install
-   Your homepage or search engine changed without your permission

#### Your files are affected:

-   Files won't open or appear corrupted
-   File extensions change (document.docx becomes document.docx.encrypted)
-   Files disappear
-   You see a message demanding payment to access your files (ransomware)

#### Strange things appear:

-   Pop-up windows, especially advertising or warnings
-   Your antivirus is disabled and won't turn back on
-   Unusual error messages
-   Your contacts report receiving strange emails from you

#### Why USB Drives Matter in Language Work

In many contexts where we work, USB drives are the primary way files move between computers - far more common than email attachments or cloud sharing. This makes USB drives the **main way malware spreads** in language projects.

A single infected USB drive shared at a workshop can infect dozens of computers. Those computers then infect other USB drives, and the problem multiplies.

### Prevention: Your First Line of Defense

Prevention is always better than trying to fix an infected computer. Here are the essential practices:

#### 1. USB Drive Safety

**Before you open any files from a USB drive:**

1.  Plug it in and **scan it with your antivirus** first
2.  Don't double-click to open it - right-click and choose "Scan with [your antivirus]"
3.  Wait for the scan to complete before accessing files

**General USB practices:**

-   Don't share USB drives indiscriminately
-   Be especially careful with USB drives from unknown sources or public computers
-   If you must use a public computer, scan your USB drive immediately afterward

#### 2. Antivirus Software

Your antivirus software is like a guard that watches for malware. But it only works if you maintain it properly:

##### Windows Defender (built into Windows)

-   Works well and requires no installation
-   Updates automatically with Windows
-   Good choice for limited connectivity areas

##### ESET

-   More powerful detection capabilities
-   Requires separate updates
-   Best with regular internet access

**Choose based on your connectivity:** If you have regular internet, ESET is excellent; if connectivity is limited, Windows Defender may be more practical.

**Keeping it working:**

-   **Keep it running** - don't disable it to "speed up" your computer
-   **Keep it updated** - updates include information about new malware
-   If you're in a low-connectivity area, update when you do have internet access

#### 3. Regular Scanning

Don't wait until you suspect a problem:

-   Run a **full scan at least weekly** (perhaps Sunday evening when you're not actively working)
-   Run a **quick scan** after using any USB drive
-   Run a scan if your computer starts acting strangely

**Note:** Include a short video or screenshots here showing how to run a scan in Windows Defender and ESET

### Recognition: When Something's Wrong

Sometimes prevention isn't enough. You need to recognize when malware might be present:

#### Clear Warning Signs:

-   Your antivirus displays alerts or warnings
-   Sudden, dramatic slowdown (not gradual over months)
-   Pop-ups that won't stop
-   Programs won't open or crash immediately
-   Files you know were there are now missing or won't open

#### Less Obvious Signs:

-   Computer feels "different" but you can't pinpoint why
-   Small strange behaviors (homepage changed, new icons on desktop)
-   Colleagues report receiving odd messages from you

**Important:** Not every computer problem is malware. Hardware failures, software bugs, and full hard drives can cause similar symptoms. When in doubt, start with a scan - it's the quickest way to rule out (or confirm) malware.

### Response: What to Do When You Suspect Infection

If you think malware might be present:

1

#### Don't panic, but act promptly

-   Disconnect from the internet if possible (unplug ethernet or turn off WiFi)
-   Don't plug in any USB drives
-   If you can, back up important uninfected files to a separate location

2

#### Run a full antivirus scan

-   Open your antivirus software
-   Choose "Full Scan" (not quick scan)
-   Let it complete - this may take 30-60 minutes
-   Don't use the computer for other work while scanning

3

#### Follow your antivirus recommendations

If it finds threats, it will usually suggest actions:

-   **Quarantine** = move to a safe holding area where it can't cause harm
-   **Delete** = remove permanently
-   **Ignore** = the software thinks it's a false alarm

For most situations, choose Quarantine or Delete as recommended.

4

#### Restart and scan again

-   After removal, restart your computer
-   Run another scan to confirm the malware is gone
-   Check that your files and programs work normally

### When to Escalate to IT

You should handle routine scans and basic malware removal. But some situations require expert help. **Escalate immediately** if:

#### 1. Ransomware Appears

-   Messages demanding payment
-   Files encrypted with changed extensions

**DO NOT pay the ransom** - there's no guarantee you'll get files back

**DO NOT try to fix it yourself** - you might make recovery impossible

**DO disconnect immediately and contact IT**

#### 2. Antivirus Can't Remove the Threat

-   Scan completes but malware remains
-   Antivirus itself is disabled and won't restart
-   Malware reappears immediately after removal

#### 3. System Is Unusable

-   Can't boot up properly
-   Blue screen errors
-   Critical system files are affected

#### 4. Sensitive Data Might Be Compromised

-   Banking information, passwords, or personal data was on the device
-   Signs that information has been sent elsewhere
-   Device is used for organizational finances or sensitive communications

**When escalating, tell IT:**

-   What symptoms you observed
-   What you've already tried (scans, etc.)
-   When the problem started
-   What work is affected
