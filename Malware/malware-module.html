        <h3 class="subsection-title">Why Does This Matter for Language Projects?</h3>
        
        <p>These aren't just annoying technical problems. In language work, malware can have serious consequences:</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Understanding What Malware Is</h3>
        
        <div class="concept-block">
            <p><strong>Think of malware like a biological virus in your body:</strong></p>
            
            <div class="analogy-grid">
                <div class="analogy-item">
                    <p><strong>Viruses spread</strong> from one person to another through contact - malware spreads from one device to another, often through USB drives</p>
                </div>
                <div class="analogy-item">
                    <p><strong>Viruses hijack</strong> your body's normal processes to reproduce - malware hijacks your computer's normal operations</p>
                </div>
                <div class="analogy-item">
                    <p><strong>Symptoms appear:</strong> fever (computer slowness), coughing (pop-ups appearing), weakness (system crashes)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="analogy-item">
                    <p><strong>Prevention</strong> (hand-washing, vaccines) is much easier than cure (medicine, rest)</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>The key difference?</strong> Your computer doesn't "feel sick" - it just follows instructions. Malware is simply <strong>code with harmful instructions</strong>. When your computer runs that code, it does exactly what the code says - even if that means deleting files, stealing information, or spreading to other devices. You can't see the code running, but you definitely see the <strong>effects</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">What Does Malware Actually Do?</h3>
        
        <p>Let's focus on what you can observe, not technical details you can't see. Malware typically causes one or more of these problems:</p>

        <div class="symptoms-grid">
            <div class="symptom-category">
                <h4>Your computer acts differently:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dramatically slower than normal</li>
                    <li>Programs crash or won't open</li>
                    <li>New programs or toolbars you didn't install</li>
                    <li>Your homepage or search engine changed without your permission</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="symptom-category">
                <h4>Your files are affected:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Files won't open or appear corrupted</li>
                    <li>File extensions change (document.docx becomes document.docx.encrypted)</li>
                    <li>Files disappear</li>
                    <li>You see a message demanding payment to access your files (ransomware)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="symptom-category">
                <h4>Strange things appear:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pop-up windows, especially advertising or warnings</li>
                    <li>Your antivirus is disabled and won't turn back on</li>
                    <li>Unusual error messages</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="context-block">
            <h4>Why USB Drives Matter in Language Work</h4>
            <p>In many contexts where we work, USB drives are the primary way files move between computers - far more common than email attachments or cloud sharing. This makes USB drives the <strong>main way malware spreads</strong> in language projects.</p>
            <p>A single infected USB drive shared at a workshop can infect dozens of computers. Those computers then infect other USB drives, and the problem multiplies.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Prevention: Your First Line of Defense</h3>
        
        <p class="emphasis-text">Prevention is always better than trying to fix an infected computer. Here are the essential practices:</p>

        <div class="practice-section">
            <h4>1. USB Drive Safety</h4>
            
            <div class="procedure-block">
                <p class="procedure-title"><strong>Before you open any files from a USB drive:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Plug it in and <strong>scan it with your antivirus</strong> first</li>
                    <li>Don't double-click to open it - right-click and choose "Scan with [your antivirus]"</li>
                    <li>Wait for the scan to complete before accessing files</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="best-practices">
                <p class="practice-title"><strong>General USB practices:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't share USB drives indiscriminately</li>
                    <li>Be especially careful with USB drives from unknown sources or public computers</li>
                    <li>If you must use a public computer, scan your USB drive immediately afterward</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-section">
            <h4>2. Antivirus Software</h4>
            
            <p>Your antivirus software is like a guard that watches for malware. But it only works if you maintain it properly:</p>

            <div class="comparison-block">
                <div class="comparison-item">
                    <h5>Windows Defender (built into Windows)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Works well and requires no installation</li>
                        <li>Updates automatically with Windows</li>
                        <li>Good choice for limited connectivity areas</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="comparison-item">
                    <h5>ESET</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More powerful detection capabilities</li>
                        <li>Requires separate updates</li>
                        <li>Best with regular internet access</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="decision-guide">
                <p><strong>Choose based on your connectivity:</strong> If you have regular internet, ESET is excellent; if connectivity is limited, Windows Defender may be more practical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="maintenance-checklist">
                <p><strong>Keeping it working:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep it running</strong> - don't disable it to "speed up" your computer</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it updated</strong> - updates include information about new malware</li>
                    <li>If you're in a low-connectivity area, update when you do have internet access</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-section">
            <h4>3. Regular Scanning</h4>
            
            <p>Don't wait until you suspect a problem:</p>

            <div class="schedule-block">
                <ul>
                    <li>Run a <strong>full scan at least weekly</strong> (perhaps Sunday evening when you're not actively working)</li>
                    <li>Run a <strong>quick scan</strong> after using any USB drive</li>
                    <li>Run a scan if your computer starts acting strangely</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="note">

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Recognition: When Something's Wrong</h3>
        
        <p>Sometimes prevention isn't enough. You need to recognize when malware might be present:</p>

        <div class="warning-levels">
            <div class="warning-level warning-clear">
                <h4>Clear Warning Signs:</h4>

                    <li>Sudden, dramatic slowdown (not gradual over months)</li>
                    <li>Pop-ups that won't stop</li>
                    <li>Programs won't open or crash immediately</li>
                    <li>Files you know were there are now missing or won't open</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                    <li>Small strange behaviors (homepage changed, new icons on desktop)</li>
                    <li>Colleagues report receiving odd messages from you</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Not every computer problem is malware. Hardware failures, software bugs, and full hard drives can cause similar symptoms. When in doubt, start with a scan - it's the quickest way to rule out (or confirm) malware.</p>
