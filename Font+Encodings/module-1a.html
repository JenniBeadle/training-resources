            <h3 class="subsection-title">The Mystery of the Broken Lexicon</h3>
            
            <p>You've just received an email from Maria, a language consultant working with a community in Papua New Guinea. She's excited—the community has completed their first phonetic lexicon with 500 entries, all carefully transcribed in IPA. But there's a problem.</p>
            
            <p>When she opens the file on her computer, it looks like this:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>[ᵐb̪ɔ̃ː] → [▯b̪▯▯] 
[ʈʂʰɤ] → [▯▯▯▯]
[ɲɟa] → [▯▯a]</pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>Half the symbols have turned into boxes. Maria can't send this to the print shop. She can't share it with the community. The work isn't wrong—but it's invisible.</p>
            
            <div class="key-point">

            <h3 class="subsection-title">The Three Layers of Text Display</h3>
            
            <p>When you see text on a screen, three things have to work together perfectly:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The encoding</strong> tells the computer which character is which</li>
                <li><strong>The font</strong> provides the shapes (glyphs) to draw those characters</li>
                <li><strong>The rendering engine</strong> puts it all together and displays it</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>When text "breaks," one of these three layers has failed. Your job as a language technologist is to figure out <em>which one</em>.</p>
            
            <div class="analogy-box">
                <h4>Think of it like a restaurant:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>encoding</strong> is the menu (tells you what's available)</li>
                    <li>The <strong>font</strong> is the kitchen (has the ingredients to make the dishes)</li>
                    <li>The <strong>rendering engine</strong> is the chef (puts it all together)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the customer orders something not on the menu (encoding problem), or the kitchen doesn't have the ingredients (font problem), or the chef doesn't know the recipe (rendering problem)—the dish doesn't arrive correctly.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Pattern 1: The Box (□ or ▯)</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What you see:</strong> Boxes, rectangles, or question marks where characters should be</p>
            
            <p><strong>What it usually means:</strong> The font doesn't have the glyph for that character</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Maria's IPA symbols are turning into boxes because her default font (probably Arial or Times New Roman) doesn't include IPA characters like [ᵐ] or [ʈ] or [ɲ].</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>The key insight:</strong> The computer <em>knows</em> which character it's supposed to display (the encoding is working), but the font can't draw it.

        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Pattern 2: The Wrong Mark in the Wrong Place</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What you see:</strong> Accent marks floating above or below where they should be, diacritics on the wrong letter, or marks that look "stacked" incorrectly</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>Intended: bɔ̃ː  
Displayed: bɔ ̃ː (with the tilde floating separately)</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>What it usually means:</strong> This is often an encoding issue—specifically, a problem with how combining characters are stored or how normalization is handled (we'll dig into this in Module 1B).</p>
            
            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>The key insight:</strong> The font might be fine, but the way the characters are <em>encoded</em> in the file is causing them to display incorrectly.

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Pattern 3: Mojibake (Scrambled Nonsense)</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What you see:</strong> Text that looks like random gibberish, often with strange accented characters where normal letters should be</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>Intended: "Hello"  
Displayed: "H�llo" or "Hèllo" or "æäö▯"</pre>

            </div>
            
            <p><strong>What it usually means:</strong> The file was saved in one encoding (like UTF-8) but opened in another (like Windows-1252), or vice versa. The computer is misinterpreting the data.</p>
            
            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>The key insight:</strong> The <em>data</em> is fine—it's just being read with the wrong decoder. Like trying to read a French book with a Spanish dictionary.
